# Swift NAVFIT

A local Microsoft Access app for drafting and reviewing Navy evaluations and fitness reports. One operational `.accdb` contains the workspace, VBA, forms, draft data, history and local review tools.

**Current prototype: 0.10.0 · schema 10.** Development is ongoing. Full NAVFIT import/export and Navy policy validation are not implemented. Printed-layout work is deferred.

## Current features

- EVAL, CHIEFEVAL and FITREP drafts with initial administrative fields, seven form-specific trait marks with reference guidance, official narratives and incomplete saves.
- Organizational folders, search, saved library views and bulk folder moves with guarded undo.
- Committed revisions, restore as a new revision, duplicate, archive/recover and field-level comparison.
- Automatic/manual pending-editor checkpoints and recovery.
- Read-only NAVFIT review, narrative-only import/reconciliation and retained source provenance.
- Attributed narrative snippets and a local draft completeness checklist.
- Revision-linked review comments, replies and resolve/reopen history.
- Local reviewer assignments, due dates, My Work, contributor switching and accept/return/cancel history.

Internal review acceptance is separate from official approval. Local contributor profiles provide attribution, not authentication. Use one contributor at a time in the same authoritative file; separate copies do not synchronize.

## Try the app

Download the blank `.accdb` from the [0.10.0 prerelease](https://github.com/MattMer/swift-navfit/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and make a working copy. Open it in trusted desktop Microsoft Access, complete workspace setup, and use Home to open the draft library. The Access Runtime and x86 environments have not been verified.

Existing populated workspaces need migration into the new app rather than replacement with its blank distribution:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/upgrade-workspace.ps1 -SourcePath 'C:\path\existing.accdb' -DestinationPath 'C:\path\upgraded.accdb'
```

The script defaults to the current release template in `output/`; download that release asset into `output/` or provide `-TemplatePath`. It preserves the source, refuses destination overwrites and verifies copied records.

## Build and collaborate

Windows and desktop Microsoft Access are required for building and integration testing. Build from text source into a fresh file:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/build.ps1 -OutputPath output/Swift_NAVFIT_review.accdb
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/smoke-test.ps1 -BuildPath output/Swift_NAVFIT_review.accdb
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, focused checks, migration requirements and pull requests. Binary databases, generated evidence, local test fixtures and supplied reference PDFs are excluded from Git. Source changes belong in `src/`, `scripts/` and `tests/`. Verified blank binaries are release assets.

The 0.10.0 build passed 425 behavioral assertions and 169 catalogue checks, plus exact narrative-import/provenance checks. Schema-9-to-10, schema-10-to-10 and schema-5-to-10 migrations preserved every original row/field and reopened. All 20 user-data tables in the blank distribution are empty. Full visual inspection and Runtime/x86 testing remain pending.
